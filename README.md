# Hotel Chain Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes booking data to improve decision-making across a hotel chain, focusing on reducing cancellations and optimizing service planning.

## Objectives
1. **Data Strategy:** Identify critical data points for analysis.
2. **Operational Insights:** Reduce cancellations and enhance planning.

## Key Metrics
- **Operations:** Cancellation rates, lead time, seasonal trends.

## Findings & Recommendations
### **Operations (Cancellation Management)**
#### Problem:
The Operations team is facing disruptions due to an increase in cancellations, which leaves rooms unrented for days, causing issues with general service planning.

#### Goal:
Develop a data-driven approach that minimizes cancellation impacts and enhances operational efficiency.

#### Cancellation Window:
- 53% of cancellations occur within 0-59 days of the arrival date.

#### Segment of Cancellations:
- **TA/TO Distribution Channel:** 40,152 cancellations, approximately 90.7% of total cancellations (44,224).
- **Online TAs:** Account for nearly half (47%) of cancellations (40,152).
- **Short-Stay Cancellations:** Short stays (0-4 nights) have a high cancellation rate of 62%.

#### Potential Causes:
- **Booking Flexibility & Cancellation Policies:** Lenient policies encourage last-minute cancellations.
- **Customer Behavior Patterns:** Short-stay customers may have alternative options, making them more likely to cancel.
- **Lack of Commitment for Short Stays:** These bookings are perceived as less financially committing, leading to higher cancellation rates.
- **Booking Lead Time:** Last-minute bookings increase the likelihood of cancellations due to sudden plan changes.

### **Proposed Recommendations:**
- Implement mandatory deposits for bookings within 100 days of the arrival date.
- Provide rebooking options.
- Remind customers at regular intervals to reduce last-minute cancellations and no-shows.
- Implement data-driven staffing adjustments.
- Collaborate with Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) to implement stronger booking commitments.

### **Conclusion**
**Summary:** By implementing cancellation policies, introducing penalties, and improving communication with guests, the operations department can better manage cancellations, optimize staffing, and increase room occupancy.

**Next Steps:** Track cancellation patterns over time to assess the effectiveness of these strategies and refine operational adjustments based on data-driven insights.
